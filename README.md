Differences between useState, useEffect, useReducer:

UseState: it is used to manage the state of components

UseEffect: it is used to handle side effects whenever a state suffers a change

useReducer: it is to handle state logic and a bit more comple way, you receive the previous state and action and depending the action you choose how to update that state
