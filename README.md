Question 3.2

Differences between useState, useEffect, useReducer:

UseState: it is used to manage the state of components

UseEffect: it is used to handle side effects whenever a state suffers a change

useReducer: it is to handle state logic and a bit more comple way, you receive the previous state and action and depending the action you choose how to update that state

WHEN TO USE FLEX VS GRID

FlEXBOX: It is used to create simple one dimensional layouts, is easier than grid

GRID: It is used to create a bit more complex layouts, where the size of the elements may change depending on the layout we want

both are great for responsive layouts
